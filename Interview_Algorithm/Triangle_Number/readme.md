# Problem
Triangle Number is defined to be all divisors summation (except itself) equals itself. 

## For example
Number 6 has all divisors `1, 2, 3, 6`, and `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, we say number 6 is the first triangle number of 4 or 3.

We can also see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over 5 divisors [`1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28` (6 divisors of `1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28`)].
## Question
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
# Solution
I don't know. My solution is time over.
