# Solution
This can be solved by pre-order traversal, then we will keep track of layers. Then push back the corresponding numbers into 2d array.
Watch that the 2d array will not be initialled, we will prepare a place where the number will be stored, 
which is if the size of array minus 1 is less than layer numbers, we will prepare the 1d array inside the 2d array.
