# Solutuion
We put every number into the stack, if we meet '*' or '/', we will multiply or divide the last two numbers.

Thus, we accumulate the number and if we meet the sign, we will deal with the previous sign (such that we have number before and after the last sign).
The same with the case in the end, we will do the same operation to deal with last sign.

Thus in the stack, all the number is what we will sum up.
