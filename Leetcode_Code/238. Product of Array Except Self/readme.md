# Solution
## Two Array
Two array stores the position that the multiplication of previous numbers and after numbers.
Then, the result is the multiplication of previous and after.
The time complexity is `O(3*n)` and space complexity is `O(3*n)`.

## One Integer
Simplify algorithm to only one array. 
The time complexity is `O(2*n)` and space complexity is `O(n+1)`.
