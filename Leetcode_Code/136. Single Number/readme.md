# Solution
* Once say the linear time, we can think of hashmap. Firstly, use hashmap to count the frequency of the value appearance, then use another for to find that single number which its count is 1.
* Hashset is one solution.
* Bit operation, use "exclusive or", we have properties:
1. x ^ x = 0
2. x ^ 0 = x
3. commutative law
